MANCHESTER , England 1996-08-29 Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped England to restrict Pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday . Croft , who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 . There was also a wicket each for Ronnie Irani , Allan Mullally and Darren Gough although there was no joy for Dean Headley who , along with Lancashire batsman Graham Lloyd , was making his international debut . After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 . Anwar , who struck a superb 176 at The Oval , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on . Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs . First , Sohail , after making 48 , was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side . Wasim , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when Croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs . Shortly after Ijaz was also back in the pavilion for 48 after Irani had repaid Mullally with another good catch at long-on . Gough later bowled Moin Khan with an inswinging yorker but Inzamam-ul-Haq , 37 not out , and Salim Malik took Pakistan to 225 for five when the overs ran out . \n",

Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-28 Conchita Martinez decided that when in New York , do as the New Yorkers do -- and the Spaniard 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the U.S. Open . The fourth-seeded Spaniard , who is tackling the world class traffic of New York City as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over France 's Nathalie Tauziat 6-1 6-3 on Wednesday to take her place in the third round . \" I 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , \" said the 24-year-old Martinez after crushing Tauziat in just over an hour . \" What I 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight . That would really help . \" Martinez , the 1994 Wimbledon champion , used to struggle at the Open , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos . \" There is a lot of things that can happen , \" Martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at Flushing Meadows . \" Like traffic . We stay in Manhattan and it 's a long way to come . The crowds , they speak louder or they move . That does n't happen in other Grand Slams . That 's where the real champion wins . You have to concentrate for these two weeks . \" It took Martinez four Opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that . Last year , Martinez , who finished 1995 ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to Monica Seles . Now she feels she is in the swing of things . \" I have my own car now and that helps , \" said Martinez . \" Sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up . This time it did n't happen . I do the driving and I love it . It gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers . \" We change lanes all the time in Barcelona .

Adrian Warner BERLIN 1996-08-29 Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey and former champion Linford Christie will run in a \" Dream Team \" sprint relay squad in honour of Jesse Owens on Friday . Johnson , the 200 metres world record holder , and Britain 's 1992 Olympic 100 champion Christie confirmed on Thursday that they would join 100 record holder Bailey and Namibia 's Frankie Fredericks in one of the greatest 4x100 squads ever assembled . They will run against quartets from the United States , Europe and Africa in a special race at the Berlin Grand Prix meeting to mark the 60th anniversary of Owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the German capital . Christie will run the anchor leg after Canada 's Bailey , American Johnson and Olympic silver medallist Fredericks have run the first three stages of the relay . The participation of Bailey and Fredericks had been known before Thursday . But Christie did not announce his decision to run until the eve of the meeting when organisers also confirmed Johnson would take part . Christie is due to retire from international competition at the end of the season although he may compete for Britain in next season 's European Cup . Although Christie , who is not racing the individual 100 metres in Berlin , took his time to agree to run , the veteran was clearly delighted to be part of the tribute to the black American . When five former Olympic 100 champions from 1948 to 1980 , who have been invited to watch the race , turned up at a news conference on Thursday , Christie was quick to put his autograph book in front of the them . \" I do n't normally do this but can you please sign , \" he said thrusting an ornate white book in front of Americans Harrison Dillard ( 1948 ) , Lindy Remigino ( 1952 ) , Jim Hines ( 1968 ) , Trinidad 's Hasely Crawford ( 1976 ) and Britain 's Allan Wells ( 1980 ) . \" Jesse Owens inspired everyone here and it is great to have a tribute to him . \" Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out by the sprinter 's grand-daughter Gina Tillman during the meeting Berlin organisers hoped to have American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in last Friday 's Brussels meeting . \n",

My understanding is the ( Serb ) police have been released ... In Zvornik , we think the situation is winding down as well , \" NATO spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Max Marriner told Reuters . NATO troops detained 65 Bosnian Serb policemen early on Thursday after they attacked Moslem refugees returning to homes in Mahala , a Serb-controlled village on Bosnia 's internal boundary line . In apparent retaliation for NATO 's detention of the Serbs , an angry Serb mob including policemen trapped six unarmed U.N. police monitors and three local aides in their office in the town of Zvornik , east of Mahala .

Peter Greste BELGRADE 1996-08-29 U.S. envoy John Kornblum met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding Bosnia 's post-war elections . The American diplomat arrived in Belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in Bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters . \" We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska ( Bosnian Serb republic ) which led to this development , \" Kornblum said after three hours of talks . But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in Bosnia as scheduled on September 14 to bolster the peace process . Kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic , the patron of the Bosnian Serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process . Bosnia 's Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved . Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest . Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing . Kornblum said only elections endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) would be legitimate . \" As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , \" he said . \" The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE . \" After meeting Milosevic , Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital Zagreb . He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders . He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat mini-state in western Bosnia .

The mayor of Acatepec , a small town some 310 miles ( 500 km ) south of Mexico City , sent a letter to Mexico 's National Human Rights Commission complaining the army 's heavy presence in the town would interfere with the Oct. 6 election . Mayor Antonio Gonzalez Garcia , of the opposition Revolutionary Workers ' Party , said in Wednesday 's letter that army troops recently raided several local farms , stole cattle and raped women . The letter was signed by some 200 area residents and indigenous leaders . Some electoral watchdog groups also said the presence of the army , which has fanned out across the state in the past month in search of a new guerrilla group , was likely to intimidate voters and had stirred up tension in the state . A French group of electoral observers , Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme , concluded the army presence exerted a heavy psychological pressure on local farmers and would prevent a fair vote . Up for grabs in the election are the state legislature and 75 town halls . ( Corrects to show elections are not for governor ) . Despite the criticism , acting state Gov .

      "ignoring document: Thai poll shows military wants PM Banharn out . BANGKOK 1996-08-29 Thailand 's powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa 's resignation might solve the nation 's political and economic woes , an opinion poll showed on Thursday . Nearly half the 1,617 military personnel surveyed in the Rajapat Institute poll suggested that Banharn resign , while about 28 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 24 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government 's problems . Banharn , who leads a six-party , 13-month-old coalition government , faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month . The prime minister , who has already lost one coalition partner this month , is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners . The poll , conducted earlier this month after Banharn 's coalition completed one year in office , showed the military would prefer General Chatichai Choonhavan -- a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in February 1991 -- as prime minister . Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh , head of coalition member the New Aspiration Party , was the second choice for prime minister , the poll showed . Banharn came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes . Nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere , and 65 percent blamed the government 's poor performance for the country 's economic slowdown . The opinion of the military in Thailand , which has seen 17 coups or attempted coups since the country switched to parliamentary democracy from absolute monarchy in 1932 , always carries weight in the political scene , despite officials ' vows to distance the military from politics . \n",

      "ignoring document: Scandal hits Clinton campaign at vital moment . Michael Conlon CHICAGO 1996-08-29 President Bill Clinton 's triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal . Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday . The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton , and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made . \" Dick Morris is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , \" Clinton said in a written statement . \" I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . \" Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue . The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton 's lead over Dole in the opinion polls . Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , called it a \" big bump \" in the way of the Clinton campaign . \" It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , \" Feinstein said . Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at 8 p.m. EDT ( midnight GMT ) . The 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers . Republicans hope to seize on the \" character \" issue to bolster Clinton 's challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign . Speaking in Santa Barbara , California , Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris , who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course , would make Clinton drift back to the left . \" Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is , \" Dole told reporters . Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt . Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech . It was apparently neglected on his long \" whistle-stop \" train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland . He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest . But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television , \" He 's really fired up . \" \" He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , \" she said . \" He 's very excited about this convention ... He 's excited about the campaign . But more than that , he 's very resolute about what he wants to do . \" \" I do n't take anything for granted . I always expect elections to get close . I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , \" she said of the November 5 election date . Clinton is leading Dole by as much as 15 points according to some polls . The campaign pits Dole , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident Clinton , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience . \n"

      "ignoring document: Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy . PHILADELPHIA 1996-08-29 University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals . Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal \" Human Gene Therapy , \" came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research . Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials . Nevertheless , \" a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , \" the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release . Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat . Death strikes in early adulthood . Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin . In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene . The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes . In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing . Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said . The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue . \n",

Simpson said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month . The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , in June 1994 . He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths . He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers . But he added without elaborating , \" hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . \" The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public . \" I would love to speak about everything , \" said Simpson , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward . His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept . 17 will be that he did not kill the victims . Simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book . He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home . \" I 'm broke . I am not crying the blues . I can get along just fine , \" he said . \" Whatever you want to send me , I need . \" He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed Washington church . Contrary to news reports , Simpson said , he has received support from both blacks and whites . He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges . A crowd of 2,000 paid $ 10 a head to hear the former star running back for the Buffalo Bills professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night . The crowd in the church was wildly supportive , showering Simpson with gifts and praise . But outside , dozens of protesters from the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence called for the church to support victims of violence instead . \n",

NEW YORK 1996-08-29 Southern California Edison Co said it expected two 220 kilovolt ( KV ) power lines in southern California to resume service later today after being shut late Wednesday because of a wildfire raging north of Los Angeles . \" They are expected to be placed in service later today , \" said company spokesman Steve Conroy , adding repair crews have been removing smoke and other fire-related residues , which had settled on the two lines . The shutdown of the 220 KV lines reduced by 500 megawatts ( MW ) the amount of power which the area received from SoCal Edison 's 1,200 MW Sierra hydroelectric facility , he said . Conroy noted two 500 KV and another 220 KV line running from the Sierra plant to Los Angeles remained in operation , and continued to carry some of the production from Sierra to the region . On Monday , the two 500 KV transmission cables were taken out of service , also for cleaning , for about a day . Containment of the fire has been difficult because of the hot , arid , windy weather in the region , Conroy said . \" The fires keep moving back because of the winds , \" he said , forcing the utility to shut those transmission lines for a second time this week .

Martin Wolk SEATTLE 1996-08-29 Sierra Semiconductor Corp jumped 23 percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business . The San Jose , Calif. , company was up 2-1/8 at 11-3/8 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment . \" Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now , but it will be a more profitable business , \" said analyst Elias Moosa of Roberston Stephens & Co . But analysts noted that Sierra still has much painful work ahead of it , including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its workforce , which currently has 500 people , and building up the business of its PMC-Sierra unit , which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks . The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 50 million to $ 80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments . Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business . \" Once you announce your intention to exit a business , it becomes a complete buyer 's market , \" he said . And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business , the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as International Business Machines Corp . \" As the market develops the question is , are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? \" Randall said . Other analysts were more bullish , even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales . \" It 's a positive strategic move , \" said Miles Kan of Hambrecht & Quist . \" The modem business is a low-margin , commodity business , \" he said . The company 's PMC-Sierra unit generated $ 33 million of the company 's $ 117 million in sales in the first half of the year , compared with $ 45 million in sales of modem chips , Kan said . But the PMC unit is far more profitable , he said . Sierra 's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand . -- Seattle bureau 206-386-4848 \n"

Some are commanding a very good premium of 95 cents to one dollar . It 's been 99 cents to Korea . This will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , \" one said . \" But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 45-50 cents .

Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 - $ 27.70 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday , up from $ 27.22 last week .

Working in the basement of the National Archives , members of the Civil War Conservation Corps are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the North so that they can be preserved on microfilm . The faded documents have been stowed away in the Archives since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day . Each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs . Since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on African American troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in Washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war . More than 185,000 black soldiers fought and 37,000 died . In one letter , a black soldier heading South wrote his wife , \" though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom . \" I would like to no ( sic ) if you are still in slavery if you are , it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty . Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me . \" In another letter dated January 1865 , a well-to-do Washington matron wrote to Lincoln to plead for her son , who faced a dishonourable discharge from the Army . \" James is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly , while those who have done nothing for the cause are free , \" she wrote . Lincoln 's notation on the letter read : \" If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , I will pardon and send him . \" The soldier was subsequently pardoned . While the letters speak to the anguish of separation , a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war . In a picture required for his military discharge , Pvt . Lewis Martin , with haunted eyes , posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg , blown off during a battle at Petersburg , Virginia , in July 1864 . The work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture , said John Simon , professor of history at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and editor of Gen . Ulysses Grant 's papers . \" These ( writings ) are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove . This is the first generation of African Americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment , \" Simon said . \" I think there 's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war , \" said Edward Smith , director of American Studies at American University in Washington . The war between the North and South raged for nearly four years , claimed the lives of half a million Americans and forever seared the nation 's consciousness . Southern records have already been preserved . They were put on microfilm about 30 years ago through a grant from the United Daughters of the Confederacy . The Civil War Conservation Corps is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year . Director Budge Weidman , who has shepherded the project from the beginning , predicts it will take up to a decade to complete . The work was inspired by a National Park Service plan to put computer databases at Civil War battlefields across the country so that Americans might research their ancestors . The records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day . One soldier was discharged because of \" mental incapacity and inebetude ( sic ) of the brain , alleged by the Patient to be connected with a fall on the head but believed to arise from long continued and excessive masturbation . \" \n",

In the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of Agriculture Ministry offices located just 50 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio . No one was hurt . A second device , packed with five kg ( 10 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said . The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new \" get-tough \" policy by Paris toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy . Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given \" firm orders \" to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice . Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed . The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless . \" No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , \" the daily France-Soir lamented . \" On the island , as at the Place Beauvau ( the Interior Ministry 's Paris address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what . It is time to end this nightly farce , \" said the pro-government daily Le Figaro in an editorial . No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday 's incidents , which brought to 23 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-August , when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce . Corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades . The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that \" 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in Corsica \" . The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government . \n",

STOCKHOLM 1996-08-29 Swedish options and derivatives exchange OM Gruppen AB said on Thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in London in the first half of 1997 . \" Together with subsidiaries OMLX , the London Securities & Derivatives Exchange and OM Stockholm , OM Gruppen will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 1997 , \" OM Gruppen said in a statement . The first commodity to be traded on the PULPEX bourse will be pulp , but OM said trade would be extended to include products such as timber , recycled paper and other paper qualities . \" Through the establishment of PULPEX , London will have a commodities bourse for forest products which complements existing bourses for oil , metals and ' softs ' ( coffee , sugar and cocoa ) , \" OM said . PULPEX was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between OM and representatives of the forest industry , the company said . Huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers ' profitability unpredictable , and made investing in new production capacity a risky business . \" Without the ability to hedge prices , changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players ' profitability , \" OM said . It said global production of pulp amounted to around 200 million tonnes per year , of which around 20 percent or 40 million tonnes was sold on the spot market . At current prices , the value of this production was around $ 25 billion . PULPEX will be both a marketplace and a clearing house , OM said , adding that the British Securities and Investments Board had been informed of OM 's plans . PULPEX 's clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by OM Gruppen to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations . -- Stockholm newsroom , +46-8-700 1006 \n",

The Norwegian news agency NTB quoted another official on the island as saying no survivors had been found .

First rescuers arrived shortly after 1 p.m. ( 1100 GMT ) and reported soon afterwards that most of the three-engine jet 's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest had slid down the mountainside . Air traffic officials said they had lost contact with the flight , scheduled to arrive at around 10.15 a.m. ( 0815 GMT ) , shortly before it was due to land .

Cellars were flooded , trees uprooted and roofs damaged , but there were no reports of any injuries , an interior affairs ministry spokesman said . Some trains were delayed as fallen trees blocked lines .

The RMT spokesman said that near the eastern city of Turnhout , a group of boy scouts camping in a low-lying meadow had to be evacuated as water flooded their tents . The rain also severely hindered Belgian investigators ' excavations in the southern village of Jumet , where they are looking for bodies in one of the houses of the main character in a paedophile sex-and-murder scandal .

LONDON 1996-08-29 The chairman of British-based components and engineering group T&N Plc said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets . In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir Colin Hope said T&N had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets . Looking at market prospects , he said : \" I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half . \" \" It 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year . It could be better , or it could be worse , \" Hope added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries . \" You can see anxieties in Germany and France , in particular , beginning to grow and develop . America , however , is looking a little better , \" he said . Compared with the end of last year , when T&N predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , Hope said : \" I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half . \" Against this background , Hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago . \" I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern African ) mines actually is not bad . \" It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , \" he added , saying : \" We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle . \" \" We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it . And we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things , \" Hope said . \" When the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , \" he added . Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of German piston maker Kolbenschmidt , which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles , Hope said T&N 's confidence \" continues to improve \" that it may eventually be able to proceed . -- Andrew Huddart , London Newsroom , +44 171 542 8716 \n"

      "ignoring document: Hong Kong 's Tsang sees growth , smooth transition . Mark Trevelyan WELLINGTON 1996-08-29 Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year . Tsang , who made the remarks during a visit to New Zealand , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the Hong Kong dollar pegged to its U.S. counterpart , and said negotiations with China on next year 's budget were going smoothly . Hong Kong 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year . Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the Hong Kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday . \" Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , \" Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch . \" There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , \" he said . He said inflation was under control and the Hong Kong dollar was \" rock solid \" . Its link to the U.S. dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years . \" There 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change . A lot of investment in Hong Kong , some of which ( is ) by China , is predicated on the link continuing . \" Britain will hand over Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 , 1997 . Tsang said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on Hong Kong 's 1997-98 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . \" None of our basic precepts have been challenged . \" Hong Kong will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves . It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to Beijing , Tsang said . He described the condition of the property market as \" very good indeed \" . \" You know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years . Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . \" Tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce . The government would put land on the market to stop rentals \" going through the roof \" , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems . \" There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , \" he said in reference to the property market .

HONG KONG 1996-08-29 Senior Hong Kong civil servants were given the go-ahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the Beijing-backed panel to choose the territory 's first post-handover leader and lawmakers . The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September 11 , three days before the nomination period for the Selection Committee closes . The government maintains the ban , announced earlier this month , is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy . Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights . The 400-strong Selection Committee will select Hong Kong 's future chief executive to replace the British governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which Beijing plans to dissolve . Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 150 years , will be handed back to China at midnight on June 30 next year . China intends to dismantle the territory 's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes Britain 's recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber , a decision that has generated considerable controversy . The judicial review sought by directorate-grade bureaucrats will apply to only about 1,000 of the approximately 33,000 civil servants affected . Police unions are not contesting the ban , which affects all 27,000 officers , and nor are the very top tier of Hong Kong 's mandarin class , the policy secretaries .

For the first six months of the year , Lenzing said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period .

      "ignoring document: Algeria faults Britain over Islamists gathering . PARIS 1996-08-28 Algeria , fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas , attacked Britain on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in London . The Islamist gathering , due to be held in London on September 8 , has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like Egypt which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists . British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist Hamas as well as the banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) are among those radical Islamists attending the conference . A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that Algeria \" has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world . \" \" Algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism , \" the spokesman said , adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in Algiers for clarifications . The Algerian ambassador in London has also asked for clarification from the Foreign Office over the meeting of Islamist groups . Algeria said \" they are clearly working to undermine the stability \" of Arab countries . British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday from Pakistan his government would only take action against the planned Islamists gathering in London if British law was broken . \" People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain , \" he said . An estimated 50,000 people , including more than 110 foreigners , have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when authorities in Algeria cancelled a general election in which FIS had taken a commanding lead . \n",

      "ignoring document: Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins . Donna Sells NEW YORK The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected . Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar . Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week . Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him . Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan . \" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , \" said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. \" Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . \" That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 . Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen . Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs and Co . Inc . \" Rubin has done a fine job in that position , \" said Michael Faust , a portfolio manager at Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds . \" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . \" Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets . Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening . As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury . \" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States , \" said Widness , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds . Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results . If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency . \" If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? ' \" said Michael Perelstein , portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds . \" And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as Rubin ) , if not stronger , \" Perelstein said . \" Otherwise , you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again . \" \n"

LONDON 1996-08-30 West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire . After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 . Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 . Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley . Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire . He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 . Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams , 123 , and Tim O'Gorman , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 . After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 . They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 . By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three . \n",

      "ignoring document: TENNIS - TARANGO , O'BRIEN SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS . Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open . The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court . Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff Tarango . The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 . The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against India 's Leander Paes . But the night belonged to the upstarts . Washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback . O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back . \" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' \" said the 26-year-old O'Brien , ranked 65th . \" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . \" The hard-serving O'Brien , a former U.S. collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington . The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead . The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 . \" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit . I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , \" said Washington . \" But I think he served pretty well when he had to . \" Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand . A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention . \" I 'm an emotional player , \" said the 104th-ranked Tarango . \" I think I played very well tonight , very focused . \" The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators . \" I love the crowd if they boo me every day . It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , \" Tarango said . \" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me . If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . \" Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics . \" He 's always complaining too much , \" said Rios . \" But I think it 's not that . I think I played really bad . It was tough to play at night . Balls were going really fast . I lost too many points that I never lose . I did n't play my tennis . \" \" I do n't see the ball like I see during the day . I play an American so that 's why I play at night . I did n't feel good on the court . \" At the end of the match , Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute . \" I support their enthusiasm , \" Tarango said about the fans . \" At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me . After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . \" \n",

MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-29 Nolan Henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger Woods shot 67 in his professional debut . Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade , Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik . Woods , who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , almost eagled the 18th hole . He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace . \" Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time , \" Woods said . \" Today , I got to play golf . \" He added : \" I thought I got off off to a great start . It was a perfect start . I 'm in a good position . \" Henke , who called his round a \" pleasant surprise , \" finished with six birdies on the final eight holes . \" We finally got things going in the right direction , \" he said . \" It was my best round in a very long time . My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often . That 's always been the worst part of my game . All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . \" Henke , who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew Magee during Wednesday 's pro-am , has three career PGA Tour victories , but none since the 1993 BellSouth Classic . Estes , whose only win came at the 1994 Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place . \" No bogeys on the card , \" he noted . \" Sometimes I take more pride in that . \" Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion Billy Mayfair , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and former U.S. Open champ Payne Stewart . Defending champion Scott Hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back . Phil Mickelson , the only four-time winner on the PGA Tour , skipped the tournament after winning the World Series of Golf last week . Mark Brooks , Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off . \n",

Adrian Warner BERLIN 1996-08-30 American Dennis Mitchell outclassed Olympic 100 metres champion Donovan Bailey for the third time at a major post-Games meeting in front of the most experienced sprinting crowd in the world on Friday . Watched by an array of former Olympic sprint champions at the Berlin grand prix meeting , Mitchell made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off Bailey 's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions . Bailey , who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in Atlanta , could not catch his American rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish . Jamaica 's Michael Green was second with 10.09 with Bailey finishing in 10.13 . Last Friday Mitchell , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , upstaged a trio of Olympic champions including Bailey to win the 100 in Brussels . Earlier this month he also beat world champion Bailey in Zurich . Berlin , Brussels and Zurich all belong to the most lucrative series in the sport , the Golden Four . Among the crowd on Friday were Olympic 100 metres champions going back to 1948 . They had been invited to the meeting to watch a special relay to mark the 60th anniversary of Jesse Owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the same Berlin stadium . \" Today the concentration was the most important thing for me , \" Mitchell said . Despite the coolish conditions American Olympic champion Gail Devers looked in commanding form in the women 's 100 , clocking 10.89 to defeat Jamaican rival Merlene Ottey , who was second in 10.94 . \n"

The Gazzetta dello Sport said the deal would cost Atalanta around $ 600,000 . Lentini , 27 , joined Milan from Torino in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities . The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in Turin .

BUCHAREST 1996-08-30 Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output , with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei . But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports , keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei . Comelf 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 , the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed . Comelf , based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita , manufactures water purification equipment , machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment . \" In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products , \" the report said . From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output , up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year . The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits . Year-on-year inflation , initially estimated at 20 percent in December , was 33.8 percent in June , higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent . The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July .

      "ignoring document: U.S. debt futures end lower , shaken by Chicago NAPM . CHICAGO 1996-08-30 U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index for the Chicago area , traders and analysts said . The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 . Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 . Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close . One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads . \" Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , \" one floor trader said . Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes . Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets . However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said . December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said . The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation . While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 . Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey , speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC , said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check . Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations . Traders said the Fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news . \" The Fed 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data , \" one analyst said . \" The revisions to GDP , for example , may not have attracted a lot of attention . \" At the end of pit trade , December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32 , 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32 , munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32 , December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94 , March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33 . \n",
      "ignoring document: Douglas & Lomason shares rise on merger . FARMINGTON HILLS , Mich . 1996-08-30 Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ 31 a share , or $ 135 million . Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange . Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price . The acquisition will beef up Markham , Ontario-based Magna 's North American car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp . Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said James Hoey , chief financial officer . \" Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , \" Hoey said . \" This merger makes us much more competitive . \" He added that Douglas & Lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined . Douglas & Lomason 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said . The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 , up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million . Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years . \" The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , \" said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co . \" It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . \" Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components . Magna , Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers , including seats , instrument panels , door panels carpeting and headliners . \n",

LONDON 1996-08-30 Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain . Police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on Saturday . The Iraqis claimed they were \" ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam ( Hussein ) \" but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered . Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq . The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum . The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London . After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives . \n",

An eye specialist told the 35-year-old Bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again , the newspaper said . The Briton , who lost his World Boxing Council ( WBC ) title to Mike Tyson in March , said : \" I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in . \" I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I 'm glad I had a good innings . \" Bruno , for years one of Britain 's most popular sportsmen , had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye . Professor David McLeod , who examined Bruno , told the Sun : \" There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again . He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that . \" Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995 . He was only the third Briton ever to hold a world heavyweight title . But Bruno lost the title on his first defence when he fought American Tyson in Las Vegas .

Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict .

Larisa Sayenko MINSK 1996-08-30 A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic . The speaker of the Belarus parliament , Semyon Sharetsky , told Reuters that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler . \" The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko , who leads this European state of 10 million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , \" Sharetsky said . The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president . Lukashenko 's aides shrugged off Sharetsky 's charge . \" If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , \" Sergei Posukhov , Lukashenko 's political adviser , told Reuters . \" The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . \" Lukashenko , 41 , won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union . But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him . \" This constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , \" he said . \" We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . \" Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation . But nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia 's backing for Lukashenko , protested against the deal . Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact .

The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February . Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups . Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire . Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children . Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it . \" Help me , help me , \" said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food . The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting . \" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , \" said Rajab Adinayev , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt . Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock . They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital . One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition . He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . \" It 's not important who holds this town , we just need to stop the war , \" he said . \n",
      "ignoring document: Polish Foreign Minister to visit Yugoslavia . WARSAW 1996-08-30 Poland 's Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati will visit Yugoslavia on September 3 and 4 to revive a dialogue between the two governments which was effectively frozen in 1992 , PAP news agency reported on Friday . During Rosati 's trip the two countries will sign an agreement on mutual protection of investments and a note easing conditions on the granting of visas , the agency quoted Foreign Ministry officials as saying . The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only country of the former Yugoslavia where Poles currently require visas . They are also to clinch protocols on culture and understanding between the two foreign ministries . Rosati will meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav politicians in Belgrade , before visiting Montenegro . Poland revived diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level with Yugoslavia in April but economic links are almost moribund , despite the end of a three-year U.N. trade embargo imposed to punish Belgrade for its support of Bosnian Serbs . Poland is seeking pacts on avoiding double taxation and wants cooperation in fighting crime . \n"

Naina Yeltsin had a kidney operation last Saturday . Earlier Russian news reports had said Yeltsin 's children and grandchildren had visited the Russian first lady but they said only that Yeltsin , on vacation outside Moscow , had spoken to her by telephone . \" Naina Yeltsin looks well , she is active , she is clearly getting better , \" Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying . Naina Yeltsin is recovering in Moscow 's Central Clinical Hospital , where the president himself was treated twice last year for heart attacks . Yeltsin , 65 , has been seen only rarely since he was elected for a second term in office on July 3 , although his aides have denied a string of rumours that he has been taken ill again . Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had travelled from the hospital to spend the night at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow .

Emese Bartha BUDAPEST 1996-08-30 Shares of France-registered printed packaging company Cofinec S.A. plunged sharply on the Budapest Stock Exchange ( BSE ) on Friday , despite a mostly reassuring forecast by the group . Cofinec 's Global Depositary Receipts ( GDRs ) opened at 5,200 forints on the BSE , down 600 from Thursday 's close , following the release of its first half results this morning . Cofinec CEO Stephen Frater told reporters in a conference call from Vienna on Friday before the opening of the bourse that he expects a stronger second half , although the group will not be able to achieve its annual profit goal . \" We will not achieve the full 37 million French franc ( net ) profit forecast , \" Frater said . \" Obviously , we cannot make up the unexpected decrease that has been experienced in the first half of the year . \" Frater declined to give a forecast for the full year , ahead of a supervisory board meeting next week . Cofinec , the first foreign company to list on the Budapest bourse , released its consolidated first half figures ( IAS ) this morning . In the conference call , Frater said he regarded Cofinec GDRs -- which are trading below their issue price of 6,425 forints -- as a buying opportunity . \" Obviously , at some point it represents a buying opportunity , \" Frater said . \" I think the reality is that we operate in emerging markets , emerging markets tend to be more volatile . \" \" My message is that the fundamental strategy of the company , its fundamental market position has not changed . \" The group , which operates in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , reported an operating profit before interest of 21.8 million French francs compared to 34.1 million in the same six months of 1995 .

Cofinec said Petofi general manager Laszlo Sebesvari had submitted his resignation and will be leaving Petofi but will remain on Petofi 's board of directors . \" Until a new general manager of Petofi is appointed ...

Mishi Saran HONG KONG 1996-08-30 Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better . The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter . Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices , with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce . Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade . \" I was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume . I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force , \" one dealer said . Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums . Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday , versus New York 's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday . Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries . Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range , dealers said , but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October . \" I still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October , in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year , \" one said .

      "ignoring document: Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up . Pierre Belec NEW YORK 1996-08-30 For Wall Street , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone . President Clinton , Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth . Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth . They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets . \" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , \" said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. \" That 's when Wall Street will need to worry . \" He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the \" bidding \" intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . \" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . \" This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion . Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan . The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget . \" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , \" said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services . During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won . Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984 , while Democrat Walter Mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost . George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks . The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade . Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election . The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent . The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits . But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 . \" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , \" said Geraghty . He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls . Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons . \" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , \" Geraghty said . Right now , Wall Street is pondering the candidates . \" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , \" Geraghty said . On Friday , the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 . For the week , it was down 106.53 points . The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 . For the week , it was down 1.55 points . The Standard & Poor 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week . The American Stock Exchange index was down 1.66 points at 559.68 , and was off 1.26 for the week . \n",
      "ignoring document: Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew . Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected . Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months . A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July . A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing . While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted . \" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , \" said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla . The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday . A third report from the Commerce Department , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat . Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth . \" The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , \" Naroff said in a written comment . The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept . 24 to plot interest-rate strategy . It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were \" mixed signals \" about the economy 's direction . \" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , \" Lindsey said . He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low \" the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . \" While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident . The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July . Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production . \" The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , \" she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary . New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products . Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June . Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June . \n"

      "ignoring document: Mexican avocados not expected in U.S . Maggie McNeil WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental United States -- will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today . \" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , \" said Paul Drazek , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman . \" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , \" said Drazek . \" We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . \" The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados . Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February . The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in California . California growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados . Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation . Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers . Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan , Mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed . Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies . The California Avocado Commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . \" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , \" said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group . Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under . \" It 's a very complicated issue , \" said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek . \" We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . \" \n",
      "ignoring document: U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer . CHICAGO 1996-08-30 Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . Bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . \" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver . I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , \" a composed Bernardin told a news conference . In 14 years as Chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . \" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , \" he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . \" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody . Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , \" he said . \" Death is a natural phenomenom . \" He said he would \" serve until the end \" as cardinal . Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early . Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues . He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches . He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy . The spare , soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after Los Angeles , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 . Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s . Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse . Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year . Bernardin , who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops . This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find \" common ground \" among American Catholics . Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a \" seamless garment . \" \n",

Brad Dorfman CHICAGO 1996-08-30 The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations . \" NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , \" said Michael Ancell , banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co . \" Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . \" St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's . Kansas City , Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest , analysts added . \" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , \" said James Weber , analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons . Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St . Louis based thrift . \" Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile , \" Weber said . Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment . Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp. , Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp. , and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois . Representatives of First Bank , Norwest , Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions . KeyCorp , contacted by phone , would not comment . With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets , Boatmen 's was the prize in Missouri , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute . \" Boatmen 's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest , \" Weber said . Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner . But NationsBank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done . \" I think Boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , \" Ancell said . But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium . They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen 's . \" I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , \" said Michael Durante , analyst at McDonald & Co . \n"

WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 The State Department refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis Farrakhan , the U.S. black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by Libya . \" I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , \" State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said . \" ... The view of the U.S. government on ( Farrakhan 's ) not accepting any gifts from Libya is well-known . \" Davies also noted : \" We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to Libya \" but he did not elaborate . The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday denied Farrakhan 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had pledged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam group after they met last January . Farrakhan organised last October 's Million Man March that brought thousands of black men to Washington for a peaceful rally . The Treasury Department said Libya was on the U.S. list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that Tripoli has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . That refusal led to the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Libya . \n",

NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the RMS Titanic from the ocean floor , a spokeswoman said on Friday . A 20-ton piece of the Titanic 's steel hull , which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland , Canada , fell back to the bottom of the sea , said Erin Purcell of Boston-based Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition . The piece of hull , lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags , had been stuck about 200 feet ( about 70 metres ) below the water 's surface before it fell , she said . It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped , she said . The steel-hulled Titanic , thought to be unsinkable , struck an iceberg on April 14 , 1912 , and sank , killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board . The wreck was located in 1985 . Passengers who had paid $ 1,500 and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on Thursday , Purcell said . \n",

City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally . But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government were tantamount to war . Tension has been rising in the region since . \" We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , \" German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said . \" All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , \" he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem .

The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month . The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the Middle East process and German-Israeli relations at their meeting on September 9 .

PARIS 1996-08-30 France on Friday expelled another African man seized in a police raid on a Paris church as about 100 Air France workers denounced \" charters of shame \" used to fly illegal immigrants home . A Guinean man , detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed , a spokesman for Air France 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said . He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said . Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention . About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants . \" We must obtain a formal commitment from ( Air France chairman ) Christian Blanc that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , \" CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said . He said civilians should not be police accomplices .

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war . Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move . The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing Israeli government . \" Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , \" Damascus radio said . It welcomed the international criticism of Israel 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy . \" It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , \" the radio said . Syria and Arabs have been dismayed by Netanyahu 's refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace , his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on Jerusalem as a unifed capital for Israel .

Palestinian President Arafat , attacking Israel 's decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on Jerusalem , went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to go to the holy city . Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress . Palestinians have been banned by Israel from travelling from the West Bank to Jerusalem since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March . And Israeli checkpoints have circled Jerusalem since 1993 , a concrete and constant reminder of Israel 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital . The PLO wants Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state . Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks . They were immediately turned back . \" I am heeding Abu Ammar 's ( Arafat 's ) call to pray at al-Aqsa and I came . It is our duty towards al-Aqsa to come and pray , \" Jamil said .

      "ignoring document: Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July . Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months . Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat . Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June . \" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , \" Commerce said . But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July . That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved . The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected . At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories . Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists . That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders . Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth . It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June . Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June . But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion . Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion . \n"

The dollar rose slightly against the German mark , but edged lower against the Japanese yen . The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65 , its largest drop since July 15 , when it closed with a loss of 161 points . In the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . In the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point , or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday 's close . \" Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities , \" said Ralph Bloch , chief technical analyst at Raymond James . \" We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow , \" he said . \" I 'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday ( Sept . 6 ) so let 's be careful . \" Wall Street on Sept . 6 faces the key monthly employment report , which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices . \" We had two very strong economic reports , \" said David Shulman , Salomon Bros . ' chief equity strategist . \" There are more worries in bond land . Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July . \" The Commerce Department reported that the nation 's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago . In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market . Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year . Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning . Dick Morris , who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents . Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton . Morris ' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term . The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks , up from 1.4767 late Wednesday . The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45 . Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks , two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by Iraq . September heating oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon , September unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and October crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel . December cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the New York Cotton Exchange despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key U.S. growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore . Overseas , London 's FTSE 100 index had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below its record of 3,922.1 , before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0 , a fall of 33.7 points .

      "ignoring document: Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth . David Jones MILAN 1996-08-30 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market . Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi , Jiangsu province , Shanghai . The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia , India and Malaysia . \" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , \" said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez . She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market . This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . \" The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia , \" said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera . Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S. , Europe and the Far East . CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-30 A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the European Options Exchange ( EOE ) said on Friday . Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today , but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system . \" It 's not ready yet . We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , \" EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters . He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks . Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid . A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed . -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000 , Fax +31 20 504 5040 \n",
      "ignoring document: OSCE defends record over Chechnya peace mission . BONN 1996-08-30 The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region . Flavio Cotti , the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem . \" The OSCE is completely involved . But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there , \" said Cotti , who is also the Swiss foreign minister . \" Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations . \" Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission , saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , president of the self-declared separatist government . Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region . Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia 's borders . \" There is no doubt that Chechnya , according to OSCE principles , belongs to a state called Russia , \" he said , pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty . He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a \" internal issue \" . \" We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out . Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity , \" said Cotti . \n",

THE HAGUE 1996-08-30 The Dutch transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an El Al freighter which left 43 dead in an Amsterdam suburb . She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El Al 's head office in Tel Aviv . The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods . Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight . Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El Al in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident . -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017 \n",
      "ignoring document: Armenians , Azeris hold peace talks in Germany . BONN 1996-08-30 Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in Germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday . The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home . An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh , which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory , since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region . The conflict , which began in 1988 , claimed over 10,000 lives . \" The main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for Nagorno-Karabakh , \" the source said . He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany . Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenian forces pull out , but will not accept Armenia 's demands for the independence of the enclave . Russia 's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam . Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the broad-based Minsk Group of countries led by Russia and Finland . \n",
      "ignoring document: Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash . Rolf Soderlind LONGYEAR , Norway 1996-08-30 The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky . Longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered . Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board . \" It 's a sight I will never forget . I will remember it for the rest of my life , \" said Stig Onarheim . He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors . The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday , just east of Longyear . \" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board . Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , \" Onarheim , 29 , told Reuters . Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses . The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden . Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly . \" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief . It 's a tragedy for everyone . We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , \" said Johan Sletten , 52 . Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter . Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter . \" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , \" she said . \" Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die . They must be having a tough time of it now . \" Barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away . Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed . They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport . Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up . At this time of year , the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses . Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden . Winter is in the air . Barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia . Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet . Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months . The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks . Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there . Only Russia has chosen to do so . \n"

Responding to a letter from the the Palestinian U.N. observer mission , Security Council President Tono Eitel of Germany said that members asked him to convey their views to Israel 's charge d'affaires , David Peleg . \" The members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations , \" Eitel said after an informal council session . \" They asked me to call in the Israeli charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him , \" he added .

LA CORUNA , Spain 1996-08-31 A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday . The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna . Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato . Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time . Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o . In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick . Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe .

ARLINGTON , Texas 1996-08-31 Juan Gonzalez homered twice and Ivan Rodriguez added a two-run shot as the Texas Rangers defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 in a matchup of division leaders Friday . Rodriguez 's 18th homer , off Chad Ogea ( 7-5 ) in the first , gave Texas a 2-0 lead . One out later , Gonzalez smacked his 40th homer , extending his hitting streak to 20 games . Gonzalez , who hit in 21 straight games earlier this season , joined Mickey Rivers as the only players in Texas history with two 20-game streaks in the same year . Gonzalez hit his second homer in the third for his fifth multi-homer game of the season . Gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 RBI broke Ruben Sierra 's team record of 119 set in 1989 . The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped . \" It 's not something I 'm going to try to explain , \" said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season . \" We 've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season . \" Roger Pavlik ( 15-7 ) gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings and became the fourth 15-game winner in the American League .

At California , Tino Martinez 's two-run homer keyed a three-run first and Andy Pettitte became the league 's first 19-game winner as the New York Yankees beat the Angels 6-2 . New York snapped a season-high five-game losing streak and also got homers from Mariano Duncan , Darryl Strawberry and Jim Leyritz . Pettite ( 19-7 ) allowed two runs and eight hits over eight innings with a walk and seven strikeouts . He improved to 12-2 following Yankees ' losses . Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth , striking out two . Ex-Yankee Randy Velarde hit his 11th homer , his most at any professional level .

It was Incaviglia 's sixth grand slam and 200th homer of his career . Baltimore 's Eddie Murray cracked his 20th homer of the season and 499th of his career . Jay Buhner hit his 38th homer and Edgar Martinez his 23rd for Seattle . The Orioles remained tied with the White Sox for the American League wild card with the Mariners a game back . In Toronto , Kevin Tapani ( 12-8 ) allowed two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and Frank Thomas hit his 29th homer and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox cruised to an 11-2 victory over the Blue Jays . Thomas , Harold Baines and Robin Ventura each collected three hits . Baines homered and scored three runs . Danny Tartabull added two hits and three RBI as all Chicago starters got at least one hit . In Oakland , Dave Telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and Mark McGwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the Athetlics blanked the Boston Red Sox 7-0 . Telgheder ( 2-5 ) snapped a personal three-game losing streak . Buddy Groom pitched a perfect ninth inning . McGwire singled home a run to spark a three-run sixth and capped the scoring with a two-run homer in the seventh . The loss was Boston 's seventh in its last 29 games . In Detroit , Todd Van Poppel pitched a five-hitter for his first career shutout and Tony Clark homered to cap a four-run first inning as the Tigers blanked the Kansas City Royals 4-0 . Van Poppel ( 3-6 ) walked two and struck out two in defeating the Royals for the second time this week . He threw 108 pitches as he lowered his ERA from 8.08 to 7.24 . Kansas City has scored only one run in two games . In Milwaukee , Marc Newfield homered off Jose Parra ( 5-4 ) leading off the bottom of the 12th as the Brewers rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins . Milwaukee has won 10 of its last 15 . Bob Wickman ( 6-1 ) pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win , his second for the Brewers . Matt Lawton hit a three-run homer off closer Mike Fetters with one out in the ninth to give Minnesota a 4-2 lead .

LONDON 1996-08-31 Essex and Kent both face tense finishes on Monday as they attempt to keep pace with title hopefuls Derbyshire and Surrey , convincing three-day victors on Saturday , in the English county championship run-in . Essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat Yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from Richard Kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose . Kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling Nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at Tunbridge Wells .

      "ignoring document: RUGBY UNION - SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL . Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday . They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests . It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil . Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes . Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties . The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points . But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal . Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap . Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous . Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts . Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try . A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter . When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late . Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

      "ignoring document: SQUASH - HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT . HONG KONG 1996-08-31 Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday . The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third . When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : \" You cheat . \" \" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , \" said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour . \" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . \" Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision . The Australian had upset Jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 . \" I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , \" he added . He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end . I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's Jansher . \" Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . \" What he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors . \" We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that . \" I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly . I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . \" Jansher , bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title , plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final . Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 . Eyles , who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993 , said that he would like to win for the good of the game . \" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him , \" said Eyles . \" My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration .

      "ignoring document: GOLF - PARNEVIK TAKES ONE-SHOT LEAD AT GREATER MILWAUKEE OPEN . MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-31 Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open . Parnevik , who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory , moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament . Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft . Nolan Henke , who led by two strokes entering the third round , carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 . He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic . Tiger Woods , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament . The 20-year-old Woods , who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , struggled on the front nine , bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four , 359-yard ninth hole . After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round , he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 . After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second , the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes . Parnevik continued to storm through the course , birdying three holes on the back nine , including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes . \" I ca n't remember when I 've putted this well , \" said Parnevik . \" I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in . \" My game feels very good . I 've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight . Whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . \" Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole . \" I did n't hit it very well today , \" said Henke . \" Jasper blew right by me . Once he did , I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up . I made some really good pars . I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon . \" Right now , I ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong . \" Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under . Steve Stricker , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under . Duffy Waldorf , who also tied for second at the World Series of Golf , carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under , including Kraft . The top four on the PGA Tour money list all skipped the tournament . \n",

Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-31 This year 's Fed Cup finalists -- defending champion Spain and the United States -- will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. Open . Spain travels to Belgium , while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March 1-2 . The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan . The semifinals are July 19-20 , and the final September 27- 28 . Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans , who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September 28-29 in Atlantic City . \" Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup , \" U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw . \" That is our sole goal . \" The United States edged Austria in Salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in April , and then blanked Japan 5-0 in Nagoya last month in the semifinals . The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles , who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1994 . Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again . \" I told Monica we need her if we want to win , \" King said . Seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match . Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open . \" We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , \" said King . \" What we like would be Seles , ( Olympic champion Lindsay ) Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez . \" If she can get that threesome together , King will feel good about her chances against the Spain 's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez . \" To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses , \" said King . \n",

CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White 's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday . Brown ( 14-10 ) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 . He struck out eight and did not walk a batter . Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season . \" Bolesy ( Florida manager John Boles ) told me yesterday , ' You have to go nine tomorrow , ' \" Brown said . \" In the early innings , I was struggling , I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch . I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth . I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . \" \" He has a devastating sinker , \" observed Reds manager Ray Knight . \" The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league . I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw ( Tom ) Seaver and ( Jerry ) Koosman when they were starting . \" In Philadelphia , Delino DeShields 's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett ( 2-3 ) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies . Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games . Darren Dreifort ( 1-1 ) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings . Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save . The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall , and nine of 11 at home . Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles . In Chicago , the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader . In the first game , Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster ( 6-2 ) outdueled Atlanta 's Tom Glavine ( 13-8 ) for his third straight win , 3-2 . Foster , a .333 hitter , helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single . The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory . Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago 's four errors . Mike Mordecai singled , doubled and homered for Atlanta , which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors , 84-50 . In Montreal , Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win . Sanders ( 8-4 ) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight . He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second , and won for the seventh time in eight decisions . The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh . Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth . Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games . In New York , Marvin Benard 's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4 . Benard , hitting .467 ( 14-for-30 ) against the Mets this season , hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch ( 8-10 ) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2 . Estes ( 3-4 ) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth . Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza , who collected a career-high four RBI , but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save . The loss was the Mets ' eighth straight , their longest slide since September 1993 , and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine . In St Louis , Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4 . Benes ( 12-8 ) allowed three runs , walked three and struck out three for the win . St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season . Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals , who won for just the third time in 11 games . Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies . In Pittsburgh , Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0 . It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game . Wall ( 9-4 ) struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win . \n",

The 30-year-old Edberg , a former two-time Open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre . \" A win is a win . I 'll take it , \" Edberg , who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory . Ironically , Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl 's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match . After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on . \" I knew he had problems with something , \" Edberg said . \" I really was n't surprised . \" Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him . \" I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , \" said Edberg , who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round . \" This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard . I had to fight hard . \" Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set . Edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set . \" That 's where the match sort of changed , \" said Edberg . \" I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . \" Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer . \" It does n't look all that bad , \" Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis . However , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final . \" I 'm always being realistic , \" said Edberg . \" Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible . If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way . \" A lot of things can happen , like tonight . \" \n",

Scotland , who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance . Austria 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post . They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide . Everton 's Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save . Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards , captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee 's decision . \" The result is acceptable , \" Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters . \" We 'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good . \" SK Rapid 's Dietmar Kuehbauer , who gave an impressive performance , said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes . \" Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch . We have lost two points . The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won , \" he said . Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska said his team had displayed great fighting spirit but sometimes lacked ideas .

PARIS 1996-08-31 Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday . The victory extended to 29 matches France 's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet , their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf . Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back . Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions . After a sterile first half , France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine Zidane . This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec , who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo . Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez .

Bert Lauwers BRUSSELS 1996-08-31 Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break . Turkish fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence . Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order . The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde . But Yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray . Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area . Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , Turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over . The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts . With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France , Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal . But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball . Belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten . Teams : Belgium - 1 - Filip De Wilde , 2 - Bertrand Crasson , 3 - Dirk Medved , 4 - Pascal Renier , 16 - Geoffrey Claeys , 6 - Gunther Schepens ( 15 - Nico Van Kerckhoven , 81st ) , 10 - Enzo Scifo , 7 - Gert Verheyen ( 14 - Frederic Peiremans , 62nd ) , 9 - Marc Degryse , 8 - Luc Nilis , 11- Luis Oliveira ( 18 - Gilles De Bilde , 88th ) .

Belgian coach Wilfried Van Moer said he had not expected Turkey to be so strong and fast . \" We started panicking a bit after the Turkish goal ... we suffered , \" said Van Moer , who succeeded Paul Van Himst as coach in April . It was Belgium 's first victory under Van Moer after two draws in friendlies against Russia and Italy . \n",

      "ignoring document: Paper says Thatcher 's office consulted astrologer . LONDON 1996-09-01 A British newspaper said Margaret Thatcher was so shaken by an IRA attempt on her life when she was prime minister in 1984 that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats . The Sunday Telegraph quoted Majorie Orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher , a Libran , after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative Party conference more than a decade ago . Orr said Thatcher 's press secretary Bernard Ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future . \" Bernard Ingham told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know , \" Orr said . Orr said she never had to telephone . She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves . Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was \" a load of rubbish \" and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher 's stars . Thatcher , dubbed the \" Iron Lady \" for her driven , forceful personality , was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry . Former U.S. president Ronald Reagan 's wife , Nancy , admitted in her biography My Turn that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband 's schedule . \n",

STIRLING , Scotland 1996-08-31 British Labour Party leader Tony Blair won a narrow victory on Saturday when the party 's Scottish executive voted 21-18 in favour of his plans for a referendum on a separate parliament for Scotland . Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election , which must be held by May 1997 . But many activists were dismayed when he abruptly decided earlier this year to hold a two-question referendum on the issue , asking Scots if they wanted a separate parliament and if it should have tax-raising powers . Many party members argued that a general election win would demonstrate popular support for a separate parliament and others said a single question referendum would suffice . Prime Minister John Major says the 300-year-old union of the Scottish and English parliaments will be a main plank in his Conservative Party 's election platform . Conservatives have only 10 of the 72 Scottish seats in parliament and consistently run third in opinion polls in Scotland behind Labour and the independence-seeking Scottish National Party . \n",

      "ignoring document: Rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census . NAIROBI 1996-08-31 A Rwandan refugee lobby group called on Saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern Zaire during a census from Sunday to be conducted by aid workers . The Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda ( RDR ) urged the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any \" policing approach \" and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation . \" The RDR appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest , \" the group said in a statement . It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by Rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into Rwanda . U.N. officials said more than 1,000 aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated 727,000 refugees in camps around the eastern Zairean border town of Goma . Only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to Rwanda in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly . Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said at the end of a visit to Rwanda last week that the Zairean and Rwandan governments agreed on an \" organised , massive and unconditional repatriation \" of the 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire . He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous , starting with the closure of refugee camps . RDR said it feared forced expulsions would start in days . Zairean troops expelled 15,000 refugees in August last year . Many of the 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire and nearly 600,000 in Tanzania refuse to go home , saying they fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of up to a million people by Hutus . \n",

Liutauras Stremaitis URUS-MARTAN , Russia 1996-08-31 Crowds of pro-independence Chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing , dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday , but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty . More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away . The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced . Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called \" Troops out ! \" . Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists . It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region . But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over . \" We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace . It 's our only dream , \" said a 30-year-old woman , Mubatik Dagayeva . Aiza Dudayeva , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . \" We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , \" said Dudayeva , adding that she was from Urus-Martan . Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave . But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists . Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars , firing their guns in the air , as the crowd rushed towards them . Mouldi Mamatuyev , in his late 20 's , dressed in black and carrying a machine gun , was welcomed by his mother and sister . \" Two sons have come back , \" said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva . \" It 's the end . We believe in God . \" Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too , and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry \" Allahu Akhbar \" ( God is Greatest ) and \" Freedom for Chechnya ! \" . The fighter , sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher , said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace . \" The war has ended if everything works out , if there is law there will be power . Only Sheriat ( Islamic law ) can end the war . \" \n",

WARSAW 1996-08-31 A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA ( BRE ) plans to rival France 's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA , Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday . Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher , mineral water firm Multico , and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million , with finance provided by BRE . The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange . \" This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions , \" the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name . A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September , the daily said . News-stand chain Ruch , which controls about 65 percent of Poland 's press distribution market , had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995 . It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism . Zycie Warszawy said the new , open consortium , which also included several listed Polish firms , would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans . It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets . Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity .

But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette .

      "ignoring document: China said to fear dissidents more than criminals . MANILA 1996-08-31 The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership , a human rights activist said on Saturday . Xiao Qiang , executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China , said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national \" Strike Hard \" campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death . Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party 's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death , Xiao said in an interview . \" China is going through this power transition period . The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , \" said Xiao , in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China . He said one of Wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption . Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price . \" Those issues are not going to go away by repression . You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , \" he said . Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class -- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform . Wang , 45 , was sentenced last month to one year 's \" re-education by labour \" but was released because of ill-health . Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide . Police beat Wang and his colleague , Chen Longde , and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well , Xiao said . \n",

      "ignoring document: Burma 's Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law . Deborah Charles RANGOON 1996-08-31 Burma 's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement . \" The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , \" Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home . Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms . In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) ahead of a party congress . Most were released but several dozen remain in custody . The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including Suu Kyi 's assistant Win Htein . The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state . But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials . \" When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way . Their families are not told , \" she said . Suu Kyi , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 . Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms . The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll . \" This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , \" she said . \" They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . \" Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison . \" Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , \" she said . \" Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . \" Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon 's Insein Prison . Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse . \" If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , \" Suu Kyi said . Hla Than , an elected member of parliament for the NLD , died in early August after being at Insein for six years . His death came five weeks after James Leander ( Leo ) Nichols , a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at Insein . Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement . But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself . \" We will carry on . Nobody is free from arrest in Burma . \" \n"

DETROIT 1996-08-31 Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks . Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts . Since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour . The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend , including Interstate 95 on the East Coast , Interstates 80 and 90 in the Midwest and Interstate 5 in California . The boards read : \" Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled , Kids in Back . \" Janet Dewey , executive director of the industry-funded National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign , said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts . A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat , she said . The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing \" smart \" air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly . Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child . Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries . \" Even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology , \" Dewey said . \" The public has n't been getting the message . \" \n",

Banisadr , an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile , accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 . Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr , who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony . Banisadr , who received political asylum in France after fleeing there in 1981 , told Der Spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct . If Germany were to extradite him , he said , it would \" lose face before the whole world \" . German prosecutors have already accused Iran 's intelligence minister Ali Fallahiyan of ordering the killing of the Kurdish leaders . Iran , which denies the allegations , urged German authorities to disregard Banisadr 's testimony and said it could hurt relations . \n",

      "ignoring document: Controversial IRA film screened at Venice festival . Vera Haller VENICE , Italy 1996-08-31 Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over \" Michael Collins \" , his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival . The film , starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts , recounts the life of Michael Collins , the Irish Republican Army 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921 . Although not due for release in Britain until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland . Jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was \" more about history than any political statement \" . \" The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time , \" Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros . \" How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ? Very rarely . \" Jordan , whose 1992 film \" The Crying Game \" also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA , said Collins was more than just a revolutionary . \" He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel , \" Jordan said . \" Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today . He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . \" Leeson , the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in \" Schindler 's List \" , plays the lead role in Jordan 's film . Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland , Collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan , played by Roberts . Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras . A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes . Noting that information about Collins was \" as mysterious as the existence he maintained \" , Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film . \" I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , \" he said . \" I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have . It is a very true film . \" One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain , in an ambush in 1922 . \" I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , \" Jordan said . \" In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today . \" \n",

Nadim Ladki AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday . But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan . China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net . Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area . The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time . Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders . Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria . Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net . It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes . Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal . Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute . Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence . Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did . Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us . The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . ' ' Japan , co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here . Hosts UAE play Kuwait and South Korea take on Indonesia on Saturday in Group A matches . All four teams are level with one point each from one game . \n",

Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback . \" He ended the World Cup on the wrong note , \" Coste said . \" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available . I think now is the right time for him to return . \" Squad : Javier Pertile , Paolo Vaccari , Marcello Cuttitta , Ivan Francescato , Leandro Manteri , Diego Dominguez , Francesco Mazzariol , Alessandro Troncon , Orazio Arancio , Andrea Sgorlon , Massimo Giovanelli , Carlo Checchinato , Walter Cristofoletto , Franco Properzi Curti , Carlo Orlandi , Massimo Cuttitta , Giambatista Croci , Gianluca Guidi , Nicola Mazzucato , Alessandro Moscardi , Andrea Castellani . \n",

Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute . A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot . Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .

Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu . The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours .

Robert Galvin MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday . Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour . Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats . All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd . Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes . His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls . Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday . He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room . The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle . It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin . Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .

      "ignoring document: CRICKET - LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY . MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday . Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat . Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him . As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take . Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper . Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings . Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago . Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected . Pakistan , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament . \n",

Marshall Faulk rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns and Jason Belser returned an interception 44 yards for a score as the Colts improved to 8-6 , the same mark as the Eagles , who lost for the fourth time in five games .

The loss by Philadelphia allowed the idle Green Bay Packers ( 10-3 ) to clinch the first NFC playoff berth . The Colts won despite the absence of injured starting defensive tackle Tony Siragusa , cornerback Ray Buchanan and linebacker Quentin Coryatt . Faulk carried 16 times , including a 13-yard TD run in the first quarter and a seven-yard score early in the final period . Justin made his second straight start for Harbaugh , who has a knee injury . Justin suffered a sprained right shoulder in the third quarter and did not return . Third-stringer Kerwin Bell , a 1988 draft choice of the Miami Dolphins , made his NFL debut and was 5-of-5 for 75 yards , including a 20-yard scoring strike to Marvin Harrison in the third period . A 39-yard interference penalty against Philadelphia 's Troy Vincent set up Faulk 's first score around left end that capped an 80-yard march 5:17 into the game and the rout was on . Eagles quarterback Ty Detmer was 17-of-34 for 182 yards before he was benched . Ricky Watters , who leads the NFC in rushing , left the game after getting kneed to the helmet after gaining 33 yards on seven carries . \n"

Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday . Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530 Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega . Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer . Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330 Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi . Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930 Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups . Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack . AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330 Can Milan sink any further ? Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed . Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield . Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury . Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330 In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala . Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini . Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330 Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago . Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury . Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals . Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330 All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack . The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle . Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless . Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws . Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano . \n",

A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress ( ANC ) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni on KwaZulu-Natal province 's south coast on Thursday night . The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting . In another attack , also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night , two men were shot dead near Umkomaas . \" We suspect that these killings are linked to politics , \" spokesman Bala Naidoo told Reuters . There had been no arrests . The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZulu-Natal and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots . They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages .

In a statement Havel , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : \" Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true American of fine origins . \" \" I look forward to continuing our good relations ... with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State . I wish her well , \" Havel said in a statement to Reuters .

Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital . Albright , born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 . As an academic , Albright studied and lectured on Europe 's 20th century problems before becoming U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . Czech diplomats , seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO , praised the selection of Albright , known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former Soveit-bloc countries . \" The nomination ... is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US , \" Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters . \" ( Albright ) is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures . \" Czech ambassador to the United Nations , Karel Kovanda , told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright \" is a little light in our diplomatic heaven , \" but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs . \n",

The ODS , a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992 . Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country 's post-Communist economic reforms . The party , led by the vigorously-confident Klaus , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of Czech parliament .

      "ignoring document: POLAND GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR SWISS ACCOUNTS . Marcin Grajewski WARSAW 1996-12-06 Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two . Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts . \" In 1970s , Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs . What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , \" Rosati told a news conference . Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato , chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee , of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland . Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews . Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two . \" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , \" Rosati said . Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . He said , however , that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called \" dead accounts \" as part of the compensation . \" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , \" Rosati said . Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims . The conservative Radical Democrats ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations . But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work . \n",
      "ignoring document: INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE . Steven Silber WARSAW 1996-12-06 Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround . So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys . It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres . Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . \" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , \" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain . Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors . Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim . Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ) . Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins . He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share . But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic . Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity . \" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , \" he said . Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . \" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , \" van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland . Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made . -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700 \n",

      "ignoring document: Britain sets conditions to clear American alliance . Edna Fernandes LONDON 1996-12-06 The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine the case last month . \" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S. , \" he said . His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed . Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared . The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe . American 's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view the terms as a \" deal breaker . \" However , it called the conditions \" more severe \" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances . British Airways 's initial response was that \" unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . \" It added that it would be \" prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . \" The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter . It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route . The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme . Lang said responses should be made to the Office of Fair Trading by Jan. 10 , 1997 . \n",

A city official , who declined to be named , explained that Goldman , Sachs , which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate , proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering . By selling the floating rate debt , the city hopes to establish a benchmark , the city official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective . The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then .

      "ignoring document: Wall St speculates about Santa Fe savior . Brendan Intindola NEW YORK 1996-12-06 Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp . Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday . Wall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a \" bear hug , \" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters . Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer . They said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term . Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer . Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit . Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said . A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list . Homestake , based in San Francisco , operates gold mines in the United States , Australia , Chile and Canada . Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million . Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million . Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana . PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion . \" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number . One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , \" he said . \" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things . But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , \" the analyst added . Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares . In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 . \" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' \" said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont . Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a \" a 32 cent bid \" because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter \" mailed \" to Santa Fe 's board . -- Wall Street Desk , 212-859-1734 . \n",

      "ignoring document: Multinational commander going back to east Zaire . Jonathan Wright NAIROBI 1996-12-06 The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside . Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of Goma . If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire , he said . \" Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , \" he said . General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home . The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area . Kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . \" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda , \" Young told reporters . But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . \" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . \" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , \" he said . Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said : \" It would have to be in the last resort . It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger . Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire . \" Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter , the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security . \" I know their ( the Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , \" the general added . He denied that his contacts , criticised by Kinshasa , with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations . \" I do n't negotiate , \" he said . \" I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . \" Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu . The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale . The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking . \n"

Raphael Kopessoua BANGUI 1996-12-06 A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui , a government minister said on Friday . With violence spiralling out of control , France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers . \" France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , \" President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso . \" French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , \" he said . Public Service Minister David Dofara , who is the head of the national Red Cross , told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son , who was not named . Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 . Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong . The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital . The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui . The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said Dofora and other witnesses . The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre . A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged . Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse 's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands . Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui , which is patrolled by French troops with tanks , is deserted . Shops and businesses have remained shut this week . The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war . Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui \" in the coming hours \" with the heads of state of Gabon , Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels . The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit . His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission . Patasse , who won Central Africa 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign . Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure . Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising . Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre . Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad . Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos . Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes . An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups . In Thursday 's fighting , French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre . \n",

Norilsk officials declined to comment . Analysts said the government , while anxious about Norilsk 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output . But it also wants Norilsk , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act . \" The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , \" Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk . It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes . \" It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future , \" Chernyshev said . He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money .

But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk 's situation . \" Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , \" said one metals source .

      "ignoring document: Mexico stocks off lows but still hit by Greenspan . MEXICO CITY Mexican stocks closed sharply lower Friday , but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated . \" It was Greenspan at first . Then once we saw the Dow ( Jones industrial average ) was not about to crash , some buyers stepped in , \" said a trader , referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , whose comments that assets were \" irrationally exhuberant \" upset financial markets worldwide . The blue-chip IPC index ended down 1.29 points , or 43.56 percent , at 3,333.05 . Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded . Mexican stocks were also hurt by U.S. long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan 's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in Mexico . Yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in Mexico , unchanged from Thursday . On the broad market , 107 stocks changed hands , of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13 . Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers . Simec , the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden Sidek group headed the losers , off 7 centavos ( 1 cent ) at 1.40 pesos ( 18 cents ) . Sidek fell 4 centavos ( 1 cent ) to 95 centavos ( 12 cents ) . Traders also remarked that Mexican ADRs suffered in New York . Heavyweights Telmex and Televisa ended off 25 cents and 75 cents , respectively , at $ 31.125 and $ 25.875 . \" Falling share prices in New York do n't hurt Mexico as long as it happens gradually , as earlier this week .

Traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on Friday was . \" Some buyers stepped in , but the market was not very convinced . Volume was lackluster , \" said one trader . \" The market 's very healthy , we 're buying , \" said another trader . Ponce said shares were certainly attractively priced in Mexico , but would not appreciate until foreign buyers stepped in , which they had yet to do . ' \n",
      "ignoring document: Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil . Simona de Logu RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday . The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said . The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said . \" Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences . Our statistics are the highest for everything , \" Hakme said . \" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market . People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . \" A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy . There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP . Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there . Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . \" What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , \" he said . Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each . Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . \" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , \" SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said . \" Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . \" Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent . Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now . \n",

DILI , East Timor 1996-12-06 East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize . Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people . It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo . The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta , who lives in self-exile in Australia . The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital . \" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta ... will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to East Timor ) , \" Alatas said on Friday . He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) in Jakarta . Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta 's rule in the territory . Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor , a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta 's move . Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo . Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved , Alatas replied : \" Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . \" Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo , Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope , and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn . Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor 's official visit to Indonesia last month , but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta . \n",

      "ignoring document: Burmese students march briefly out of campus . Vithoon Amorn RANGOON 1996-12-06 About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said . Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute . There were no clashes . \" They are now back in the YIT campus , \" an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone . One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities . But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said . They were singing peacefully . On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October . On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . She was allowed to move freely on Thursday . The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon . The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising . Thousands were killed or imprisoned . Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government . They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . \" We still want government answers to our demands . We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , \" one student said . But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) . Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students . But they have said both parties had a \" moral link \" in that they were against police brutality and injustice . The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October . The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration . The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising . On Friday , the road leading to Suu Kyi 's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police . \n",

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in Singapore . Bill Jordan , general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was \" outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world \" . Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links . \" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , \" Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade . The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda . Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . Bill Brett , chairman of the ILO Workers Group , told Reuters before the news conference he was \" not too surprised , but very disappointed \" that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . \" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , \" he said , adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda . ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . The ILO wants a trade and labour rights \" social clause \" included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering . Speaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard Eglin , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems . But he said the WTO 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO . \n",
      "ignoring document: Indian rubber demand seen outstripping production . SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday . K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes . For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added . \" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , \" he said . Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes . In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes . One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India . \" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , \" he said . -- Singapore Newsroom ( 65-8703305 ) \n",
      "ignoring document: Japan 's authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar . George Nishiyama TOKYO 1996-12-06 Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday . In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen . This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . \" I think his views on ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , \" said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank . Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar . \" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger . In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , \" he said . \" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , \" said Sumitomo 's Note . Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo , said : \" Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . \" Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply . He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the \" Sakakibara ceiling \" for the dollar following the remark . Adding to the comments by \" Mr Yen \" , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark . \" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , \" Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun . \" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , \" said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co . Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan 's economy . \" There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen . The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , \" said Taisuke Tanaka , market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo . Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative . \" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , \" a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday . The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent . \n"

      "ignoring document: Lebanon sentences pro-Israeli warlord to death . Haitham Haddadin BEIRUT 1996-12-06 A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges . The court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war . Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel . Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state . He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit . The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel 's side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods . Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel . No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon . Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies . Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd . Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd \" a great Lebanese patriot \" , said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges . Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon \" unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders . \" The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr , former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars , a small rightwing Christian civil war militia . Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's , was convicted of \" contacting the Israeli enemy , passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon \" . \n",

As Glenn Lawhon , a rural Florida minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for the murder of Lester Lawhon . Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris , who was present at the execution . \" I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God , \" he quoted Mills as saying . Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam . Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty . Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him .

APPLETON , Wis . 1996-12-06 A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday . In sentencing Darrel Voeks , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was \" a thief by habit . \" \" You are self-indulgent . You are narcissitic , \" Luebke said at the sentencing , adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him . Voeks , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children . But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper .

      "ignoring document: Half of dog bites provoked , says American vet . CHICAGO 1996-12-06 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday . The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children . \" Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , \" Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association . \" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them . Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction . Let 's respect their territories , \" he said . Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children . He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed . Don Rieck , president of the National Animal Control Association , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female . The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , German shepherds , cocker spaniels and Dalmatians . \" The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique . Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman . Today , Rottweilers are on the way up , \" Rieck said . If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away . \n",

Evelyn Leopold UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06 Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election . The nominees , according to diplomats , are : Kofi Annan of Ghana , the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania , the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast , its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger , the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference . Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana , the Ivory Coast , Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said . It was not known if other candidates would step forward . Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria , a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country . Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race . His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse . The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him . The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee . The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali 's term expires . \n",

Members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) shouted pro-Hindu slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the Babri mosque , which was razed on December 6 , 1992 . The house was first adjourned for two hours . When it reconvened , BJP deputies resumed the slogan-shouting , and deputy speaker Suraj Bhan suspended work until Monday .

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05 The United States Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move \" does not make sense . \" \" All of us who have been victimised by terrorists ... need to stand together against terrorists . We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world , \" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said . ' Mohammed Rashid \" is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars . It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence ... This is an incomprehensible move . It does not make sense , \" Burns told a news briefing . He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years . The Clinton administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government , Burns said . Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters . Rashid , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982 . His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 . A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years , with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term , but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece . The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim . Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial , held at Korydallos prison , said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four U.S. citizens . \n"

      "ignoring document: Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks . Elif Kaban GENEVA 1996-12-06 In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age . But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether . After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time . Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases . \" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , \" a frustrated Western delegate said . \" They announced they will start evening sessions next week . \" Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices . \" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles . It 's fair use . We can read sports statistics or stock prices . But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , \" said James Love , a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology . \" None of the treaties are ready to move . These people do n't understand what they 're doing . \" At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce . Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old Berne Convention . But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries . A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet . Mongolia 's state copyright official , Gundegma Jargalshaihan , said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda . \" We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia , \" he added . Alexander Bavykin , deputy legal chief at Russia 's foreign ministry , said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace . He too had never browsed the Net . \" I 've never tried it and why should I ? There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , \" he said . A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse . \" Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , \" said Marc Pearl , vice-president of the Information Technology Association of America , a trade association of U.S. network companies opposing the treaties . \" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here . People here do n't understand Internet technology . Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . \" Before the Internet , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood . Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes . But the Internet , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse , has ripped up the rulebooks . Network operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities . \" There are 500 million messages transmitted through the Internet everyday , \" said Tim Casey of the U.S.-based MCI Communications Corporation . \" How can we control them all ? \" \n",

Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua , where the party has set up its own \" parliament of the north \" , Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called \" my friends from the League \" to work instead for federal reform . \" It is an invitation , a commitment , a promise . Let 's march together , \" Scalfaro , a northerner himself , said . \" Help Italy to teach , to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy , for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood . But turn back from the line you are taking now , \" he said . Scalfaro was in Mantua to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity . He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of League supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security . Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians who waved tricolour flags in the national red , white and green or shouted \" Viva Italia \" . The League won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto Bossi later switched to a separatist agenda . A three-day \" independence \" march along the Po River in September , culminating in a declaration in Venice of a self-styled \" Republic of Padania \" , flopped badly . \n"

TOKYO 1996-12-06 Japan 's Economic Planning Agency has not changed its view that the economy is gradually recovering , despite relatively weak gross domestic product figures released on Tuesday , EPA Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya told reporters on Friday . He said the GDP growth was weak but that this reflected the economy between July and September and did not take into account more recent data . When asked about the outlook for the fiscal year beginning in April , Nukaya said the economy may slow down in the early part of the fiscal year due to a planned consumption tax hike , but that would be only temporary . The consumption tax will be raised to five percent from three percent from April 1 . \n",

      "ignoring document: Bre-X , Barrick said to continue Busang talks . K.T. Arasu JAKARTA 1996-12-06 Canada 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia , sources close to the talks said on Friday . \" The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta , \" one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations . Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said , who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan . The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold . The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold . \" Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , \" the source said . He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang 's central region , which might take up to two years . The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick . \" This is a huge project ... we are not selling furniture , and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to , \" the source said . \" While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , \" he added . The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal . The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property . \" As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , \" the source said . The Ministry 's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property . The government also wants 10 percent of the property . Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies . He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find . Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto 's eldest son , Sigit Harjojudanto , under which Panutan would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang 's richest parts . Barrick has teamed up with a construction company in the Citra Group of Suharto 's eldest daughter , Siti Hardianti Rukmana , in what Barrick had said was a partnership \" to prepare us for a potential mining development project \" . \n",

      "ignoring document: FEATURE - Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO . Ramthan Hussain SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said . \" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , \" said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A . \" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . \" The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 . In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered . That would have meant Geneva . But Singapore had the support of other WTO members . Derek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore 's hosting of the conference \" carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . \" There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but \" more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market \" , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore . At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector . Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks . \" There is tension at every step of the way , \" since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said . Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , \" however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . \" From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry , Tan said . A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean \" would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , \" Tan said . \" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . \" Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda . \" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , \" he said . \" But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this . I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . \" \n"

WHISTLER , British Columbia 1996-12-06 World Cup ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme . For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler Mountain , leaving the scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy . Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged . Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday . \" There was no possibility today to make a training run , \" said Bernd Zobel , the Canadian men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility . If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned . \n",

ABU DHABI 1996-12-07 South Korea made virtually certain of an Asian Cup quarter-final spot with a 4-2 win over Indonesia in a Group A match on Saturday .

But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up , Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute . The Koreans then appeared to relax , allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match . Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out . With 65 minutes gone Indonesia 's Widodo Putra , who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday , was again on target , breaking through the Korean defence to beat the keeper with a low shot .

Charlton , 61 , and his wife , Peggy , became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton 's achievements as the national soccer manager . \" The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life . It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great , great friends in Ireland . That is why this is so emotional a night for me , \" Charlton said . \" It was the joy that we all had over the period , that I shared with people that I grew to love , that I treasure most , \" he added . Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches , during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 .

      "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb . Peter Blackburn BRUSSELS 1996-08-22 The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer . \" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , \" the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing . He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union . He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through \" dangerous generalisation . \" . Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal . The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials . Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe . \" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , \" Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio . Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef . Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports . \n",

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT representations can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE benchmark to 80.4% (7.6% absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7 (5.6% absolute improvement) and the SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5% absolute improvement), outperforming human performance by 2.0%.\"\"\"\n",
